Record

TID //transaction ID
index
amount //of coins
string scriptSig //will contain signature and full pubKey
string scriptPubKey //will contain pubKeyHash of recipient



Transaction

TID //transaction ID
recIn //array of input records
recOut //array of output records
timestamp



Block

height //block number
timestamp
prevBlockHash
blockHash
merkleRoot
nonce
transactions //array of transactions



BlockchainHandler

//The handler should be able to
//open file(DB)
//add blocks
//access blocks by height
//spits out a block object at all times after handling



Dependencies(for now):
cryptographic libs, repeated hashing with modified nonce
Database management system, to store blockchain
Networking in c++, many-to-one transaction request
